## Analysis Plan

### Clean and Tidy Data

#### Missingness
Three values assessed household characteristics: Marital Status, Household
Income, and Presence or Absence of Children. If these were missing for only one
individual in a dyad, the other individual's response was used.

#### Discordant Responses
Partners were given three questions that asked them to assess household values.
As such, they should be concordant across both responses. In cases where they
were not, the larger of two values was selected and assigned to both partners.

### Create New Variables

####  Dyadic Concordance
The absolute difference between the patient and their partnerâ€™s COST score.
Dyadic concordance increases as this measure approaches zero. The directional
difference was also calculated, to explore which dyads experienced higher
patient-level financial concerns, and which dyads experienced higher
caregiver-level financial concerns. Similar measures were created for other
HRQoL questions.

#### Time from Diagnosis
The number of days from diagnosis to study entry were calculated.

### Primary Analysis

#### Pearson
We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients for COST measures between
partners at each timepoint.

#### Multivariable regression
We calculated the impact of baseline characteristics on COST concordance in a
 multivariate linear regression model.

### Secondary Analysis

#### Pearson
We calculated Pearson correlation scores between COST and each of the
psychosocial measures. We report correlation coefficients for each individual,
as well as using the dyadic concordance score.

### Sensitivity Analysis

#### Income
- Assume lower of two if not missing

#### Children
- Assume no children if disagree
